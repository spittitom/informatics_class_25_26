Goal
Develop a lean, performant RESTful API for managing and querying medication stock levels 
and patient prescriptions. The API should leverage modern asynchronous Python features.

Technology Stack
-	Web Framework: FastAPI
-	Data Validation & Serialization: Pydantic
-	Database Simulation: A simple in-memory Dictionary (or a list of dictionaries) 
    to simulate data access. (For a real-world application, this would be replaced 
    by SQLAlchemy or AsyncPG.)
-	Asynchronicity: async/await

Requirements (Endpoints)
1.	POST /medications/
    -	Function: Adds a new medication to the inventory.
    -	Body: Requires a MedicationCreate schema.
    -	Response: The created Medication object with a generated id and an initial 
        stock\_level of 0.
2.	GET /medications/{med_id}
    -	Function: Retrieves the details of a specific medication.
    -	Response: The Medication object or a 404 Not Found error.
3.	PATCH /medications/{med_id}/stock
    -	Function: Updates the stock level of a medication.
    -	Body: Requires a StockUpdate schema (only stock\_change). The change can be 
        positive (inflow) or negative (outflow/dispensing).
    -	Validation: The stock level must not become negative.
    -	Response: The updated Medication object.
4.	GET /prescriptions/search
    -	Function: Searches for prescriptions based on a query parameter patient\_id 
        or medication\_id.
    -	Response: A list of Prescription objects.
